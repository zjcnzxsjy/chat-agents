          # Academic Style Examples

          **Original**: "Write about AI"
          **Enhanced**: "Conduct a comprehensive academic analysis of artificial intelligence applications across three key sectors: healthcare, education, and business. Employ a systematic literature review methodology to examine peer-reviewed sources from the past five years. Structure your analysis with: (1) theoretical framework defining AI and its taxonomies, (2) sector-specific case studies with quantitative performance metrics, (3) critical evaluation of implementation challenges and ethical considerations, (4) comparative analysis across sectors, and (5) evidence-based recommendations for future research directions. Maintain academic rigor with proper citations, acknowledge methodological limitations, and present findings with appropriate hedging language. Target length: 3000-4000 words with APA formatting."

          **Original**: "Explain climate change"
          **Enhanced**: "Provide a rigorous academic examination of anthropogenic climate change, synthesizing current scientific consensus and recent research developments. Structure your analysis as follows: (1) theoretical foundations of greenhouse effect and radiative forcing mechanisms, (2) systematic review of empirical evidence from paleoclimatic, observational, and modeling studies, (3) critical analysis of attribution studies linking human activities to observed warming, (4) evaluation of climate sensitivity estimates and uncertainty ranges, (5) assessment of projected impacts under different emission scenarios, and (6) discussion of research gaps and methodological limitations. Include quantitative data, statistical significance levels, and confidence intervals where appropriate. Cite peer-reviewed sources extensively and maintain objective, third-person academic voice throughout."

          # Popular Science Style Examples

          **Original**: "Write about AI"
          **Enhanced**: "Tell the fascinating story of how artificial intelligence is quietly revolutionizing our daily lives in ways most people never realize. Take readers on an engaging journey through three surprising realms: the hospital where AI helps doctors spot diseases faster than ever before, the classroom where intelligent tutors adapt to each student's learning style, and the boardroom where algorithms are making million-dollar decisions. Use vivid analogies (like comparing neural networks to how our brains work) and real-world examples that readers can relate to. Include 'wow factor' moments that showcase AI's incredible capabilities, but also honest discussions about current limitations. Write with infectious enthusiasm while maintaining scientific accuracy, and conclude with exciting possibilities that await us in the near future. Aim for 1500-2000 words that feel like a captivating conversation with a brilliant friend."

          **Original**: "Explain climate change"
          **Enhanced**: "Craft a compelling narrative that transforms the complex science of climate change into an accessible and engaging story for curious readers. Begin with a relatable scenario (like why your hometown weather feels different than when you were a kid) and use this as a gateway to explore the fascinating science behind our changing planet. Employ vivid analogies - compare Earth's atmosphere to a blanket, greenhouse gases to invisible heat-trapping molecules, and climate feedback loops to a snowball rolling downhill. Include surprising facts and 'aha moments' that will make readers think differently about the world around them. Weave in human stories of scientists making discoveries, communities adapting to change, and innovative solutions being developed. Balance the serious implications with hope and actionable insights, concluding with empowering steps readers can take.
